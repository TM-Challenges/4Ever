            "description": "Raymond is good at sequences. He has made a puzzle that no one in his class could solve. It involves taking a number, finding the number of letters it has, then making this number the new number, and doing this over and over again to form a sequence. Raymond found that he would always end up repeating forever at the number 4, because it has 4 letters, four. He showed some sample sequences to get 4, but none of his classmates could solve the puzzle. He is exhausted from having to count out new patterns, so he gives the task to you. You must write a program to display the sequence from an input to 4.",
